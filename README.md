# PlantTraits
software group project
The PlantTraitsAI project aims to predict six vital plant traits—such as leaf area and plant height—from citizen science plant photographs using deep learning models like CNNs and Transformers. By leveraging over 30,000 labeled images and integrating ancillary environmental data (climate, soil, and satellite-based information), the model captures both visual and ecological context to improve trait prediction accuracy. A multi-task learning approach is employed to predict all traits simultaneously, exploiting their interrelationships. This project contributes to ecological science by enabling large-scale, automated trait estimation, supporting biodiversity research, and enhancing our understanding of how ecosystems respond to global environmental changes, especially climate change.
